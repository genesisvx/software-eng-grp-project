        <p>a b s t r a c t The present research work was designed to evaluate sago pith meal (SPM) as feed for ruminants. A particle size distribution (Experiment 1) was determined in SPM prepared from sago logs by use of three different rasping sizes (large, medium and small). The large rasping produced a negligible amount of fine particles and a large amount of large particles, while small rasping produced a negligible amount of large particles and a smaller amount of fine particles than the medium rasping. Since both large and fine particles are not desirable, the SPM produced by the small rasping was considered the best as feed for ruminants and was used in two experiments with sheep (Experiments 2 and 3) to determine the digestibility and growth performance/carcass quality, respectively. Sheep were divided in each experiment into three treatments and each group was fed one of three SPM based diets: (1) control diet (CNT) contained SPM and soybean meal, (2) USM diet contained SPM, soybean meal and urea, while (3) UFM diet contained SPM, fish meal and urea. In the Experiment 2, the digestibility of dry matter was not different (P&gt;0.05) among the diets, but the digestibility of neutral detergent fiber was lower (P&lt;0.05) for the USM and UFM diets than for the CNT diet. However, there was no difference (P&gt;0.05) between the USM and UFM diets. In Experiment 3, the means for the average daily gain, feed intake, carcass weight, dressing percentage and lean meat were not different (P&gt;0.05) between the USM and UFM diets, but all were higher (P&lt;0.05) for the CNT diet than for both the USM and UFM diets. It was concluded that the small rasping is best for preparation of SPM as feed for ruminants, and that a highly soluble and rumen degradable protein supplement is more efficient than urea to support the maximum microbial growth in the rumen of sheep fed diets based on SPM supplemented with soybean meal or fish meal.</p>

      <title>1. Introduction</title>
      <p>
        Sago belongs to a group of starch-bearing palms found in the Malay Archipelago that stretches from the Philippines to
Papua New Guinea. The most common and productive species that is grown in the Borneo part of Malaysia, mainly Sarawak,
is Metroxylon sagu. It is used commercially for production of starch. However, there is abundance of sago in Malaysia and
dried rasped sago pith has been used for feeding animals since 1873
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref3">(Burkhill, 1966)</xref>
        . Together with sago flour, the whole
sago pith meal (SPM) may be grouped into an energy feed based on an international classification standard
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref12">(Harris et al.,
1968)</xref>
        . The use of feed sources containing highly fermentable carbohydrate such as SPM is important in optimizing livestock
production in Malaysia as the lack of energy in commonly available feeds is more critical than the lack of other nutrients.
Several studies have been conducted on the use of SPM in diets of pigs and poultry, but very few with feeding SPM to
ruminants. The ensiled sago fiber with molasses and urea resulted in poor growth in lambs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27 ref28">(Yardav and Mahyuddin, 1991)</xref>
        ,
but when supplemented with corn grain and fish meal the growth of lambs was greatly improved
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref27 ref28">(Yardav et al., 1991)</xref>
        .
There is no recent information on feeding SPM to sheep, especially the type of dietary protein supplement such as rumen
degradable protein (RDP), rumen undegradable protein (RUP) and/or non-protein N (NPN) required to obtain a reasonable
growth, feed utilization and carcass quality in sheep. Also, there are numerous commercial factories in Malaysia that produce
SPM from sago logs using different sizes of rasping, which can produce different rasping sizes of SPM. The feed particle size
dynamics affects the nutritive value of feeds
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Murphy and Kennedy, 1993)</xref>
        ; the relatively large particles affect the normal
passage from the rumen
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Faichney and Brown, 1991)</xref>
        , while fine particles formed lumps in the stomach resulting in lower
digestion in the intestinal tract of pigs
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Ivan and Farrell, 1976)</xref>
        and grinding too finely corn grain had negative effect on
gain and feed conversion efficiency in feedlot cattle
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Corona et al., 2005)</xref>
        . Therefore, it was hypothesized that different sizes
of rasping may produce different distribution of sizes of particles and, therefore, not all rasping sizes may be suitable to
produce SPM for use in diets of ruminants. Consequently, the first objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis
by the determination of the particle size distribution and chemical composition from use of different rasping sizes to prepare
SPM from sago logs by a factory in Sarawak; a rasping size that produced the largest proportion of desirable medium and
small size particles and smallest proportion of undesirable large and fine size particles in SPM was then selected. The second
objective was to use the selected rasping size SPM as dietary base in combination with supplements of soybean meal (SBM)
as RDP, fish meal (FM) as RUP and urea as NPN to assess the potential of SPM based diets in terms of the digestibility, growth
performance and carcass quality in sheep.

      <sec id="sec-3-1">
        <title>2.1. Particle size distribution—Experiment 1</title>
        <p>Three routinely used rasping sizes (large, medium and small) were used to prepare SPM from split sago logs by a
commercial factory in Sarawak, Malaysia. One batch of each large and medium rasping and two batches of small rasping were
prepared and used in the present Experiment 1 to determine the particle size distribution. Approximately 130 g sample from
each batch was each placed on the top of a series of 11 sieve pens fixed on a particle test-sieve shaker (Endecotts Model
EFL2 mk3, Chelmsford, Essex, UK). The pen with the largest mesh openings was placed on the top, followed down with the
decreasing mesh openings, with a collection pen on the bottom. There were two different mesh size sieves for the large mesh
sieve group and three for each medium, small and fine mesh sieve group (Table 1). Seven larger mesh size sieve pens were
manufactured by the N.V. Metaagaas, Hangelo, Holland, while the remaining smaller size mesh sieve pens were supplied
by the Endecotts, Chelmsford, Essex, UK. Each sample was shaken for 5 min. The particles retained on each sieve and on the
bottom collection pen were weighed. The weights on the sieves assigned to large, medium, small and fine mesh groups were
combined and their percentage of the sample weight was calculated. The chemical composition was determined for each
rasping (Table 1), while the mineral composition was determined only for the small rasping (Table 2).</p>

        <p>Sheep used in the two experiments were housed in individual pens with automatic drinking nipples and slatted floor
in an open wooden sheep barn raised above the ground. All sheep were drenched with Systamex (Welcome Foundation
Ltd., London, UK) to control internal parasites. The care of the experimental animals was in accordance with the country
standards (including halal slaughter) and the experimental protocol was reviewed by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee.</p>

      <sec id="sec-3-3">
        <title>2.3. Diets (Experiment 2 and 3)</title>
        <p>Three experimental total mixed diets were prepared using the small rasping SPM (determined in Experiment 1 to be the
most appropriate for feeding ruminants as discussed bellow), and three sources of the dietary N; SBM as RDP, FM as RUP
and urea as soluble NPN (Table 3). The diets were (1) CTN-control diet containing SPM and SBM, (2) USM diet containing
SPM, SBM and urea, and (3) UFM diet containing SPM, FM and urea.</p>
        <p>In the control diet (CNT) SBM provided most of the dietary crude protein (CP), while in the other two diets majority of
the CP was as NPN in the form of urea and SPM and the rest of CP was either SBM (diet USM) or FM (diet UFM). All three diets
were approximately isonitrogenous (2.7 to 2.8 g N/kg dry matter (DM)) and isocaloric (16 to 17 MJ gross energy/kg DM).
Ammonium sulfate provided required dietary sulfur, while the vitamin–mineral premix (Vifosmin 2, Lazuli Sdn. Bhd., Kuala
Lumpur, Malaysia) provided required dietary vitamins and minerals. The total mixed diets were prepared at approximately
2-weekly intervals and a small amount was taken from each mixed diet as a sample.</p>

        <title>2.4. Digestibility—Experiment 2</title>
        <p>Nine one-year old male sheep were shorn and randomly assigned to three treatment groups in a Latin square experiment
with three diets (Table 3) and three periods replicated over three squares. Over 30 days prior to the start of the experiment
the sheep were fed a sheep commercial diet (based on rice bran and SBM) and occasionally placed into metabolism crates
for training. All sheep were weighed before the start of the experiment. The experiment consisted of three test periods, each
of two weeks adaptation and 5 days collection of feces. Dietary rations were weighed and fed twice daily in equal portions
at 08:30 and 16:30. Before feeding, all rations were mixed with 15% water by weight to prevent waste and dustiness. During
the adaptation the amount of feed offered to individual sheep was adjusted to minimize refusals. The total fecal output was
collected, weighed and sampled (10%) daily before the morning feeding. The feed intakes and refusals were recorded and
sampled (10%) daily. Samples of feces, feed and refusals were accumulated in plastic bags. All samples were stored at −20 ◦C
for chemical analysis.</p>

        <title>2.5. Growth performance and carcass quality—Experiment 3</title>
        <p>
          Twenty one approximately four months old male sheep were used in a feeding experiment lasting 91 days. The sheep
were weighed and blocked into seven groups of three animals each in descending order of their initial weights. The sheep
in each group were then randomly assigned to three dietary treatments based on a randomized block design
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref9">(Cox, 1980)</xref>
          and fed the diet CNT, USM or UFM ad libitum in excess (10%) of individual intakes. Feed refusals were collected weighed
and sampled each morning before feeding. Individual feed intakes were recorded daily. The sheep were allowed to adapt
to the assigned experimental diet for two weeks prior to the start of the 91-day experiment. Thereafter they were sheared
and weighed on two consecutive days after feed and water was withdrawn for overnight. The same shearing and weighing
procedure was used at the end of the experiment. The average of the two consecutive weighing was considered as the initial
or final live body weight. The sheep were also weighed monthly during the experiment.
        </p>
        <p>After the end of the feeding experiment two heaviest sheep from each treatment were starved for 24 h, weighed and
slaughtered (halal method). This procedure was repeated every 2 days until all lambs were slaughtered. Dead weights were
recorded immediately after slaughter. Thereafter they were skinned, eviscerated and the heads and shanks removed. Each
carcass was split into halves through the middle of the spine by an electric saw. The warm carcass weight was taken as the
sum of the two halves, while the chilled carcass weight was the weight of the two halves after 24 h chilling at 4 ◦C. Other
measurements made on the chilled carcass include the kidney fat, channel fat and the back fat thickness. The thickness was
measured at the 12th rib incision of the left carcass side. The left side of the chilled carcass was manually separated into lean
meat, bones, and subcutaneous and intramuscular fats (separable fats). The weights of these components were multiplied
by two to obtain their estimated total weights in the whole carcass and to calculate the meat:bone ratio. The calculations
were as follows:</p>
        <p>100
Dressing % = hot carcass weight × starved live weight</p>

      <sec id="sec-3-6">
        <title>2.6. Chemical analysis</title>
        <p>All samples of SPM, diets, refusals and feces were dried in an oven at 60 ◦C for 48 h and ground to pass 1 mm screen in a
Wiley Mill (Model 4; Thomas Scientific, Swedesboro, NJ, USA). Analytical DM was determined by overnight drying at 103 ◦C.
The samples were stored in air tight glass containers.</p>
        <p>
          Concentrations of ash and organic matter (OM) (method no. 7.009), and ether extract (EE) (method no. 13.033) were
determined according to
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">AOAC (1984)</xref>
          . The determination of fiber fractions, neutral detergent fiber (aNDFom) and acid
detergent fiber (ADFom), without sodium sulfide and expressed free of ash was based on the procedure of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref25">Van Soest et al.
(1991</xref>
          ). However, it was noted that aNDFom extraction from SPM using normal strength aNDFom solution did not dissolve
all the starch present, which caused difficulty in filtration. Therefore, the samples were pre-digested by incubation at 38 ◦C
overnight in amylase (EC 3.2.1.1, Type I-A; Sigma, St Luis, USA) solution (1 ml enzyme suspension in 1 L of distilled water
containing 3.56 g KH2PO4 and 7.22 g Na2HPO4 at pH 7.0). This was followed by digestion in a more concentrated aNDFom
solution
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref6">(Close and Menke, 1986)</xref>
          . Determination of ADFom was similar to that for aNDFom; the ADFom digestion
solution contained 11 N H2SO4 and 20 g acetylthrimethylammonium bromide. The lignin with ash residue left after ADFom
procedure was ashed in a muffle furnace at 550 ◦C for 4 h to determine the concentration of acid insoluble ash (AIA). The
concentration of the acid detergent lignin (ADL) was then calculated by subtracting AIA from the lignin with ash residue,
while the concentration of cellulose was determined by subtracting the concentrations of hemicelluloses, ADL and AIA from
the concentration of aNDFom. All the above procedures were sequential on the same samples. The starch concentration in
SPM samples was determined according to previously reported procedures
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref2 ref26">(Woods and Aurand, 1976; Aurand et al., 1987)</xref>
          .
Crude protein was determined by micro-Kjeldahl procedure, while bomb calorimetry (Adiabatic Oxygen Bomb Calorimeter,
Par Instrument Co., Moline, IL, USA) was used to determine gross energy.
        </p>
        <p>For determination of mineral elements the SPM samples were digested in a solution comprising of 12 ml 65% HNO3, 12 ml
70% HClO4 and 1 ml 98% H2SO4. After appropriate dilution with deionized water the concentrations of Ca, Na, K, Fe, Cu, Co,
Mn, Zn and Cd were determined using atomic absorption spectrophotometer (Shimadzu model AA-680, Kyoto, Japan). The
concentration of phosphorus was determined colorimetrically using autoanalyzer (Technicon Instrument Co., Tarryton, NY,
USA).</p>
        <p>
          The rib chop samples were defrosted and prepared for EE based on the method no 13.033 of
          <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref1">AOAC (1984)</xref>
          . The meat was
separated from the vertebral bone and minced in a blender. About 3 g of the meat was transferred in a previously tarred
and dried cellulose extraction thimble containing a small portion of purified sand and glass rod. The sample was thoroughly
mixed with the sand in the thimble by using the glass road, placed in a 50 ml beaker for drying at 125 ◦C for 1.5 h. Thereafter,
crude lipids were extracted with ether in a Soxhlet apparatus (Narang Medical Limited, New Delhi, India).

use of the small rasping of sago logs produced the best type of SPM. This is because the small rasping produced a negligible
amount of large particles and lower amount of fine particles in comparison with the medium rasping. Although the large
rasping also produced a negligible amount of fine particles it also produced a very large amount (62%) of large size particles
that affect normal passage from the rumen
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref10">(Faichney and Brown, 1991)</xref>
        . Reduced size of corn grain increased daily gains
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref11 ref24">(Galyean et al., 1979; Turgeon et al., 1983)</xref>
        and starch digestibility
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref18">(Ouellet et al., 2010)</xref>
        in finishing steers. On the other hand,
fine size particles were found to produce lumps in the stomach of pigs, which did not permit good penetration and mixing
with digestive substances, resulting in a lower digestibility of the diet
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref13">(Ivan and Farrell, 1976)</xref>
        . Also, too fine grinding of corn
grain had negative effects on daily gains and feed conversion efficiency in finishing steers
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref7">(Corona et al., 2005)</xref>
        . Clearly, the
feed particle size dynamics affects the nutritive value of feeds in ruminants
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref16">(Murphy and Kennedy, 1993)</xref>
        and the size of
rasping did not appreciably affect the chemical composition of SPM in the present study (Experiment 1). Therefore the small
rasping preparation of SPM appears to be the most suitable as ruminant feed and was selected for the follow-up experimental
work with sheep in the present study (Experiments 2 and 3).

        The CNT diet comprised of approximately two thirds SPM and one third SBM, and resulted in a reasonably good growth
performance (gain, feed intake and feed:gain ratio) of sheep. However, when approximately 76% of the SBM portion in the
CNT diet was replaced by an equivalent amount of N in the form of NPN (urea; diet USM) and increased amount of SPM the
growth performance of sheep decreased. This was in spite of approximately the same apparent digestibility of DM and OM
in the two diets. It is though interesting to note that the digestibility of aNDFom and the feed intake of lambs fed the USM
diet decreased. Although the feed palatability might have been negatively affected somewhat by the extra dietary SPM and
the urea supplement, the lower digestibility of aNDFom was most probably responsible for the lower feed intake. This is in
agreement with the suggestion of
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref15">Leng (1990)</xref>
        that the voluntary feed intake may be stimulated by higher digestibility. This
would indicate that the rumen microbial activity was negatively affected by the increased dietary SPM and urea supplement,
resulting in the lower digestibility of aNDFom and increased rumen fill in the present experiment. A lower feed intake and
growth of goats was reported when SPM replaced 60% of a commercial concentrate diet
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref23">(Tuen, 1994)</xref>
        . However the dietary
SPM had a positive effect on the nutrient utilization, while the growth performance and digestibility was not affected when
SPM replaced corn grain in the diet of cattle
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref17 ref4">(Chanjula and Ngampongsai, 2009; Ngampongsai and Chanjula, 2009)</xref>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        The replacement of SBM in the diet USM with FM (diet UFM vs diet USM) resulted in only a small improvement in the
growth performance of sheep. In addition to poorer growth performance and digestibility there was also indication for
poorer carcass composition in sheep fed urea in combination with SBM or FM (diets USM and UFM vs diet CNT). This was
especially so in the case of dressing percentage and lean meat yield. It therefore appears that although the level of N in the
form of ammonia available to rumen bacteria might have been adequate for all three diets, there was probably shortage of
available amino acid/peptide N for maximal growth of bacteria in sheep fed the diets USM and UFM. In addition, SPM contains
high percentage of rumen fermentable starch that would contribute to higher rate of energy release in the rumen. A greater
amount of available energy in the rumen leads to a requirement for more RDP
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref8">(Cooper at al., 2002)</xref>
        .
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref20">Rooke and Armstrong
(1989)</xref>
        drew attention to the importance of a supply of RDP, such as casein, rather than NPN, such as urea, in stimulating
rumen microbial N synthesis. Indeed
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref21">Satter and Armstrong (1975)</xref>
        pointed out that dietary urea is rapidly hydrolyzed in the
rumen, but rumen carbohydrate degradation and microbial growth is slower process than the releasing of ammonia N, thus,
urea is inefficiently used by microorganisms. Also, it was reported
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref5">(Chen et al., 1987)</xref>
        that rumen bacteria have a preference
for peptide N, which might be supplied by RDP. A sufficient amount of RDP must be present in the diet to support maximum
bacterial growth yield and fermentation in the rumen
        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="ref14">(Ivan et al., 1996)</xref>
        . It is apparent that the supplements of urea with SBM
or FM have not fulfilled this requirement in the present experiment. Additional research is conducted in this laboratory to
gain more information on the effects of the present SPM based diets on rumen fermentation, microbial synthesis of protein
and duodenal flow of the dietary components.

      <title>5. Conclusion</title>
      <p>A properly prepared SPM appears to be acceptable source of the dietary energy for ruminants and the small rasping size
is most appropriate for its preparation from the sago logs. Such preparation results in good distribution of sizes of particles,
without excessive amounts of large and fine particles that negatively affect digestion of the diet by ruminants.</p>
